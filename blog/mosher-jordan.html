		<p>Mosher-Jordan Hall was the dorm I lived in freshman year.  I had a room on the 4th floor, and it was decent, for a freshman dorm at least.  The room was small, but the common spaces were super nice and bougie, so I think I really lucked out.</p>
		<p>This being where I lived, I was probably here the most out of all the other places.  My go-to locations in Mosher-Jordan were the lounge on my floor with TV and armchairs, the main common room on the second floor with a grand piano and huge long table, and the two living rooms on the first floor with adjacent kitchens.</p>
