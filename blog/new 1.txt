Trust-busting and preventing monopolies isn't "fascist economic control".  That's a talking point used by neocons to scare us out of equitable economic policies.  Even though we have existing laws against monopolies, the size and power of corporations today shows that those regulations either aren't going far enough or they aren't being adequately enforced.  Breaking up big tech monopolies is a good idea to increase market competition and create more viable platforms for people to post content if they don't like the rules of existing platforms.

Yes, you can be a libertarian but support government regulations and oversight.  Having a truly free market completely devoid of rules and regulations is impossible, as the Gilded Age showed us: the most free type of market economy there is has regulations to keep the larger fish from eating all the smaller fish and to prevent overstepping of reasonable power boundaries.  Plenty of libertarians just want to do away with stupid social prohibitions, like gun bans and marijuana being illegal.
