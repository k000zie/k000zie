		<h2>What's This?</h2>
		<p>This website documents my experience on campus at the University of Michigan as a freshman from Welcome Week in late August 2019 to campus shutting down and me moving back home in mid March 2020.  By clicking the link at the top, you will be taken to a blog page where you can visit each of those places in a sort of primitive version of a virtual tour, accompanied by my own thoughts, stories, and observations regarding each place.  I've given each image a descriptive caption and designed this whole website minimalistically for accessibility and easy viewing from all platforms and web browsers, including those that may not have graphic capability.</p>

		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>It's an interesting story.  When campus shut down in mid March, I, along with the rest of my classmates, had to move back home and do my classes remotely for the rest of the semester.  I was sad about cutting my freshman year short and leaving everyone I met, but I found the remainder of the semester to be rather enjoyable as I didn't have to worry about commuting or looking presentable.  Plus, I felt like I had a whole world to explore in my computer screen.  However, eventually I started missing campus and looking forward to when I could return.  I originally thought things would be back to normal by the end of the summer, and I spent a lot of time hyping myself up for the fall, but that didn't happen.  I was disappointed, but I went into my sophomore fall doing all my classes remotely at home, with the hope that I would return for winter semester pushing me forward.  Unfortunately, the third wave hit the US and once again I had to face the hard truth that I would be stuck in another remote semester.  This really took a toll on my morale and mental health, and it continues to even though the third wave has largely subsided and the vaccine rollout is speeding up.  At this point, it looks like my junior fall will be the earliest that I can possibly return to UMich and try to pick up where I left off before it's time for me to graduate.  In the meantime, I decided to make this website as a way to reflect on the good (and the not-so-good) times I had while I was on campus, with both happy feelings about the past and optimism about the future.  Have fun looking around!</p>

		<h2>Going Forward</h2>
		<p>For now, I'm keeping an eye out on the news daily, and I'll be getting my first shot soon.  I'll reach out and try to rebuild some of the connections I lost since last March, and save up for the upcoming year.  I'm determined to make the 2 years I have left the best ones yet.</p>
